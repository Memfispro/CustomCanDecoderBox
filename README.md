The CAN Decoder Box SourceCode is in this Repo.
it uses the MCO2515 Library: https://github.com/atc1441/arduino-mcp2515 (included) 
and the LowPower Library for STM32duino: https://github.com/stm32duino/STM32LowPower

Also you need to install The STM32duino Core/Library: https://github.com/stm32duino/Arduino_Core_STM32


You can get the PCB files for the BluePill here: https://easyeda.com/lolerino/cantest
